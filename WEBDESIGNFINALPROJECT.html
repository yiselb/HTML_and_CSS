    <h1><b>Electronic Waste</b></h1>
    <p>introducing and understanding the relationship between tech creation and the environment</p>

 <div class="intro">
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Every year, new inventions or improvements  in technology replace old ones. We love newer and improved gadgets that make our lives more efficient than before, but do these new technologies harm our environment? 
The best way to illustrate this issue, and how it effects some parts of the world more than others, is through real pictures. All the information on this website is information gathered from different news sources and a Statista report on electronic waste. This information represents an overview on worldwide electronic waste from 2010 to 2018. Additional regional articles on how electronic waste affects certain countries are linked in the images. This website's purpose is to create awareness on an issue that many of us do not know about and to show the complicated relationship between the tech revolution and our environment.</p>

  <h2>What is electronic waste?</h2>
  <p>
    Electronic waste is either one of two things. It is either your now disposed of smartphone, computer, tablet, and more. Electronic waste is also the byproduct or scraps left over from creating technologies such as smartphones, computers, tablets, and other electronic devices.</p>

<p>Global electronic waste forecasts from 2010 to 2018 show that the production of e-waste grows every year. In 2010, 33.8 million metric tons of e-waste was produced and in 2018, 49.8 million metric tons of e-waste was produced. </p>

<p>In 2016, in million metric tons, it can be seen just how much the category "electronic waste" envelops : 16.8 on small equipment, 9.2 on large equipment, 7.6 temperature exchange equipment, 6.6 on screens, 3.9 on small IT, 0.7 on lamps. </p>

  <h2>Production Statistics</h2>
  <p>In 2016, the regions that generated the most electronic waste were: 
    <ul>
      <li>	Asia (18.2 million metric tons) </li>
      <li>	Europe (12.3 million metric tons) </li>
      <li>	Americas (11.3 million metric tons) </li>
      <li>	Africa (2.2 million metric tons) </li>
      <li>	Oceania (0.7 million metric tons) </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>But, although those regions generated the most e-waste overall, it is also important to look into which regions generated the most e-waste per capita(per unit of population) as well. In 2016, these regions generated the most e-waste per capita: 
  <ul>
    <li>Oceania (17.3 kilograms or 38 pounds)</li>
    <li>Europe (16.6 kilograms or 36.5 pounds)</li>
    <li>Americas (11.6 kilograms or 25.5 pounds)</li>
    <li>Asia (4.2 kilograms or 9 pounds)</li>
    <li>Africa (1.9 kilograms or 4 pounds)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>This information can be further broken down to see which countries in particular are the largest generators. 
In 2016, the top ten countries that generated the most electronic waste were: 
    <ul>
      <li>China (7,211 metric tons)</li>
      <li>Japan (2,139 metric tons)</li>
      <li>India (1,975 metric tons)</li>
      <li>Germany (1,884 metric tons)</li>
      <li>United Kingdom (1,632 metric tons)</li>
      <li>Brazil (1,534 metric tons)</li>
      <li>Russia (1,392 metric tons)</li>
      <li>France (1,373 metric tons)</li>
      <li>Indonesia (1,274 metric tons)</li>
      <li>Italy (1,156 metric tons)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What is being done?</h2>
     <p> Electronic waste has been addressed by the United Nations in the most recent years. Since 2010, the amount of electronic waste initiatives  globally undertaken by the United Nations fluctuated from year to year with the lowest amount of initiatives being in 2010 with just five, and the highest in 2015 with twenty-eight initiatives. Data from 2018 was not represented, but in 2017 there were only three proposed initiatives. 
By region, in 2016, these were the amount of e-waste initiatives taken:
        <ul>
          <li>Asia & Oceania (33)</li>
          <li>Africa (25)</li>
          <li>Europe (19)</li>
          <li>Latin America & the Caribbean (13)</li>
          <li>North America (1)</li>

  <h2>Tracking American E-waste</h2>
  <p>The Basel Action Network(BAN) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Senseable City Lab teamed up to create MONiTOUR, an application that shed light on where electronic waste generated in the United States ends up once it is disposed of. 
GPS trackers were attached to printers, LCD and CRT monitors and sent to various  recyclers and charities.
